# **Real testimonials from real people**

> We are very happy with the result and were extremely impressed with the professionalism of both you and your team. Our neighbours have also commented on how well it was all completed. We are more than happy to provide any verbal references, if required, and will be recommending your business to anyone who is considering having similar work done. PS .I love the pile of mulch that was left.

**Kim Newell, New Town.**

> I am very impressed by Modern Arbor's professionalism and prompt and efficient service. Stuart quoted and completed the job with no fuss. He then followed up to ensure that I was happy with the work that was carried out. I have no hesitation in recommending him to others. My hundred year old White Gum looks terrific and should be standing for many years to come.' 

**Sally Burgess, Lindisfarne.**

> Stuart and his crew removed a large sprawling Mountain Ash from our back yard in Fern Tree. The tree was hanging over our treasured gardens, chook house, neighbouring property and was also very close to our house. We are very impressed with the skill and knowledge that Modern Arbor used to remove the tree with no damage whatsoever to anything underneath! Truly impressive! And the clean up was top notch too.

> It's obvious that Modern Arbor not only know about trees, they care about trees as well. Whether removing entire trees, pruning dead wood, or advising on the health and suitable siting of trees on our property, their work is both considered and first rate. I can't recommend them highly enough.Thanks Stuart and team you are gems!

**Tracey Diggins, Mt Nelson.**

> We were impressed by Stuart's caring and professional approach from the start, and the end result did not disappoint. He and his team did a wonderful job removing two trees for us. They were quick, efficient and took real care so that the only evidence of their work is the wonderful sunshine flooding in with no damage to any surrounding property or vegetation at all. Thanks very much!
