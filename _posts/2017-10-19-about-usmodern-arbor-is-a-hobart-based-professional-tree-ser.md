# **About us**

Modern Arbor is a Hobart based professional tree service provider servicing Southern Tasmania and other locations state wide as required.

Owner / manager and tree climber Stuart Primrose is qualified in Biology of Plants (UTAS) and Horticulture/Arboriculture and Conservation and Land Management (TAFE Tasmania).

For your peace of mind. Modern Arbor has public liability insurance to the value of $20 million dollars, and workers compensation insurance for our employees.

We are a registered contractor with Colliers International and our OH&S systems are independently audited by Noel Arnold and Associates.

We offer a high level knowledge of trees and their biology, and will provide an unbiased opinion of your trees condition and offer management options to help retain your tree, or if necessary, the high level of skill required to remove an unsafe or dead tree. Whether your tree is sixty metres tall or six metres tall we have the skills and training to carry out any work you require to the highest standards.

Modern Arbor is more than just another tree service. We are passionate about trees and are committed to finding new ways of keeping trees safe, healthy and beautiful. At Modern Arbor we understand that trees are important assets that require professional care and maintenance and unlike most other tree services we proudly utilise modern spike-less tree climbing techniques that wont damage the trees you care for.

From complex tree removals over precious property and plants, specialist pruning and installation of tree support systems, or fruit tree pruning for a bumper crop. Modern Arbor can help you care for your assets.

We are committed to ensuring a safe work site for ourselves and our customers and all of our work is genuinely carried out to the Australian standard AS4373 -- 2007\.

Satisfied customers include residential, commercial, government, local councils and schools.

We offer a wide range of services to enhance your home environment and help keep you safe.

With qualified operators, affordable rates and full insurance for your peace of mind why would you call any one else?
